description: StreetHawk's Push Module lets you send push messages to your application. Depending on your application's current state, if your application in foreground, the push notification overlays on the current screen as a notification dialog with user to take action and for application in background, the SDK generates a notification in notification bar. Push modules also support custom dialog.
